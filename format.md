# System Design Documents

## Objective

Create a detailed, structured, and visually engaging document on a given system design topic. The document should:

- Follow a specific format
- Include real-world examples
- Use Mermaid diagrams
- Cover key concepts, advantages, challenges, and edge cases

## Instructions

### Document Structure

1. **Title**: Clearly state the topic (e.g., "Database Partitioning: Sharding, Range, Hash-Based").

2. **Introduction**: Define the topic and its purpose in 2–3 sentences.

3. **Sections**: Divide the topic into logical subtopics (e.g., Sharding, Range Partitioning, Hash-Based Partitioning).

4. **Real-World Examples**: Include at least one real-world example for each subtopic.

5. **Mermaid Diagrams**: Use Mermaid diagrams to visually represent concepts (e.g., data flow, architecture).

6. **Comparison Table**: Provide a table comparing different approaches or techniques.

7. **Key Jargon Explained**: Define technical terms used in the document.

8. **Interview Tips**: Include practical tips for discussing the topic in interviews.

### Content Guidelines

- **Introduction**: Briefly explain the topic and its importance in system design.

- **Subtopics**: For each subtopic:

  - Define the concept.
  - Explain how it works.
  - List advantages and challenges.
  - Provide a real-world example.

- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Create diagrams to illustrate data flow, architecture, or partitioning strategies.

- **Comparison Table**: Compare different techniques or approaches in a table format.

- **Key Jargon**: Define 3–5 technical terms related to the topic.

- **Interview Tips**: Provide 2–3 actionable tips for discussing the topic in interviews.

### Style and Tone

- Use clear, concise, and professional language.
- Avoid overly technical jargon unless defined in the "Key Jargon Explained" section.
- Use bullet points, numbered lists, and headings for readability.
- Ensure the document is visually engaging with diagrams and tables.

### Mermaid Diagram Guidelines

- Use Mermaid syntax to create diagrams.
- Diagrams should illustrate key concepts (e.g., data flow, replication, partitioning).
- Label nodes and edges clearly.

### Real-World Examples

- Include examples from well-known companies or systems (e.g., Twitter, Google, Amazon).
- Explain how the example relates to the topic.

### Comparison Table

- Use a table to compare different techniques or approaches.
- Include columns for features, advantages, challenges, and use cases.

### Key Jargon Explained

- Define technical terms in simple language.
- Use examples or analogies if necessary.

### Interview Tips

- Provide practical advice for discussing the topic in interviews.
- Include tips for handling edge cases, trade-offs, and real-world scenarios.
