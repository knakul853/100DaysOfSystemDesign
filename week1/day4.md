# Core Difference: High availability vs. fault tolerance

High Availability (HA): Aims to minimize downtime. The system might experience a short interruption during a failure, but recovers quickly.

Fault Tolerance (FT): Aims to eliminate downtime. The system continues to operate seamlessly even when a component fails.

## Key Points to Understand:

| **Use Cases**  | Web servers, databases, APIs, applications               | Mission-critical systems (e.g., medical devices, aircraft control, nuclear plants), financial transaction systems |
| **Examples**   | Load balancers, clustered databases, standby servers     | Triple-modular redundancy (TMR), mirrored storage, redundant power supplies                                       |

## Talking Points:

### Tradeoffs:

HA is generally more cost-effective and simpler, making it suitable for many applications. FT is more expensive and complex, reserved for extremely critical systems.

### Recovery Time (RTO):

HA focuses on reducing RTO, the time it takes to restore service. FT aims for an RTO of zero.

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO):

HA may have a small data loss, depending on the mechanism and failure. FT minimizes/eliminates any data loss.

### Levels:

Both HA and FT have levels of implementation. For HA, it might be active-passive or active-active clusters. For FT it might be with redundant hardware at various component levels.

### Types of Failure:

HA is resilient to component failures, software issues, and network glitches.

FT is specifically resilient to single points of failure.

### Not Mutually Exclusive:

A system can leverage a combination of HA and FT strategies, with HA at the application level and FT at the component levels for the most critical components.

## Q&A:

### 1. When would you choose HA over FT?
   Choose High Availability (HA) when:
   - Cost is a concern: HA is cheaper and simpler than FT.
   - Some downtime is acceptable: A few seconds or minutes during failover.
   - Scalability is important: HA is easier to scale with load balancers.
   - Use Case Examples: E-commerce websites, streaming platforms.

### 2. Describe a scenario where FT would be essential.
   Fault Tolerance (FT) is essential in systems where zero downtime is critical:
   - Example: Airplane control systems must continue operating seamlessly during failures to ensure safety.
   - Other Examples: Medical devices, nuclear reactors, high-frequency trading platforms.

### 3. What are the key technical challenges in implementing an FT system?
   - Cost: Full redundancy is expensive.
   - Complexity: Designing seamless failover and real-time replication.
   - Latency: Synchronizing redundant components without delays.
   - Failure Detection: Quickly identifying real failures vs. temporary issues.
   - State Consistency: Keeping all components in sync.
   - Testing: Simulating failures effectively.

### 4. How does your approach to HA or FT affect scalability?
   HA:
   - Easier to scale with horizontal scaling (e.g., adding servers behind load balancers).
   - Focus on performance and availability.
   FT:
   - Harder to scale due to the cost and complexity of full redundancy.
   - Requires synchronization of each added component.

### 5. How would you monitor a system for HA and FT?
   For HA:
   - Monitor uptime, failover time, and load balancer health using tools like Prometheus or Grafana.
   - Set alerts for unavailability or high error rates.
   For FT:
   - Track redundancy health, replication lag, and simulate failures (e.g., Chaos Monkey).
   - Use tools like Datadog or New Relic and set alerts for inconsistencies or backup failures.

## Analogy:

Imagine a bus service between two cities:

High Availability:
If one bus breaks down, another bus is sent out as a replacement. There’s a slight delay (downtime), but the service resumes quickly.
Fault Tolerance:
If one bus breaks down, another bus that's running in parallel instantly takes over, and passengers don’t notice any disruption.
